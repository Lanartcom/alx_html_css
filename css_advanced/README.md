CSS Advanced Project Plan

Introduction
This project focuses on applying advanced CSS concepts to create a well-styled webpage based on a provided Figma design. The goal is to use only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, adhering to best practices and ensuring W3C compliance.

Project Overview
The project involves styling an HTML page and its various sections, including the header, banner, quotes, videos, membership, FAQ, and footer, according to the specifications outlined in the Figma design.

Tasks Completed
1. Importing the Style
I created a styles.css file and imported it into the < head > section of the index.html, establishing a foundation for all styles throughout the webpage.

2. Styling the Header and Banner
I styled the header and first section of the page based on the Figma design, ensuring that all colors, widths, heights, and images matched the specifications.

3. Designing the Quotes Section
Next, I focused on the quotes section, applying the appropriate styles as indicated in the Figma file. I centralized common styles in the CSS to maintain consistency and reduce redundancy.

4. Styling the Videos List
I added styles to the videos list section, making sure the layout and design aligned with the Figma specifications.

5. Implementing the Membership Section
I styled the membership section to reflect the design in Figma, paying close attention to layout and visual hierarchy.

6. Designing the FAQ Section
I applied styles to the FAQ section based on the Figma layout, ensuring that the styling was coherent and user-friendly.

7. Styling the Footer
Finally, I styled the footer to ensure it harmonized with the overall design of the webpage as specified in the Figma file.

Conclusion
This structured approach allowed me to effectively apply my CSS knowledge and create a visually appealing webpage that adheres closely to the design specifications. Each section was carefully crafted, resulting in a cohesive final product.
