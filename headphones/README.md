Web Page Implementation from Scratch

Project Overview
In this project, I implemented a web page from scratch based on a design created by Nicolas Philippot, a UI/UX designer. The goal was to build the page without using any external libraries or frameworks, utilizing only HTML, CSS, and responsive design techniques. The final result closely mirrors the designer’s file, and the page is fully responsive, functional, and accessible.

Requirements
No external CSS frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap) were used.
No JavaScript was utilized.

Steps Followed
1. Figma Setup and Design Review
I began by creating a Figma account and duplicating the project’s design file to my drafts.
I reviewed the design layout and gathered all relevant details, such as fonts and spacing.
I installed the required fonts: Source Sans Pro and Spin Cycle OT, to ensure the design's typography matched the designer's intent.
2. HTML Structure and CSS Styling

Header / Hero Section
I started the development process by building the header and hero section of the page.
I implemented a CSS reset to ensure consistency across browsers and established CSS variables for colors, fonts, and other properties to maintain flexibility.
The HTML was structured with semantic elements, and I made extensive use of div containers for flexibility.

“What We Do” Section
In this section, I integrated custom font icons from the holberton_school-icon.zip archive.
I focused on creating reusable components that I could utilize in future sections of the page, ensuring that the CSS was as generic as possible.

“Our Results” Section
I reused the components from the “What We Do” section to maintain a consistent style and save development time.
Instead of using image files for the pentagon shapes, I used pure HTML and CSS to draw them.
Contact Us Section
I added a contact form, ensuring it was responsive and user-friendly.
For better user experience, I added input field constraints and optional animations on hover or focus.

Footer
Finally, I implemented the footer, using the same reusable components and keeping the layout clean and functional.
3. Responsive Design Implementation
I ensured the entire web page was responsive by using media queries. The layout adapts seamlessly to smaller screens, with a mobile version appearing when the screen width is 480px or less.
The content was centered and limited to a maximum width of 1000px, ensuring readability on larger screens.
4. Interactive Elements and Animations
I added hover and active effects for links and buttons:
Links change to #FF6565 when hovered or active.
Buttons have an opacity change to 0.9 on hover or active states.
In the “What We Do” and “Our Results” sections, I incorporated animations, including scaling and opacity changes, to make the page feel more dynamic and engaging.

Final Result
By following these steps, I successfully built a fully responsive and accessible web page that looks nearly identical to the original design file. The process helped me improve my skills in HTML, CSS, and responsive design, while reinforcing the importance of clean structure and reusable components.

This project represents a major milestone in my ALX FE program, showcasing my ability to implement professional web designs from scratch.
